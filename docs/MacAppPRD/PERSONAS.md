This document defines the target users for Hearth, their needs, pain points, and how Hearth addresses them.

---

## Primary Persona: Sarah (The Family Manager)

### Demographics
- **Age:** 38
- **Role:** Working mom, Marketing Director
- **Family:** Husband (Mike), Emma (12), Jack (8), Mother-in-law (Rose, 72)
- **Location:** Suburban Maryland
- **Tech:** MacBook Pro, iPhone, Apple Watch

### A Day in Sarah's Life

**6:00 AM** - Wake up already thinking about the day's logistics  
**6:30 AM** - Make lunches while checking work email  
**7:15 AM** - School drop-off (did Jack remember his permission slip?)  
**8:00-5:00** - Work (while fielding texts about after-school activities)  
**5:30 PM** - Pick up Jack from soccer, Emma had a ride  
**6:00 PM** - Start dinner (what are we even having?)  
**7:00 PM** - Homework help while cleaning up  
**8:00 PM** - Call mom-in-law to check in (she sounded tired)  
**9:00 PM** - Finally sit down, remember tomorrow's schedule

### Pain Points

1. **Mental Overload** - "I'm the family's external hard drive. If I don't remember it, it doesn't happen."

2. **Invisible Labor** - "Mike helps when I ask, but I'm tired of being the one who always has to ask."

3. **Elder Worry** - "I worry about Rose living alone. Our daily calls help, but I can't always reach her."

4. **School Chaos** - "I found out Emma had a project due tomorrow... at 9pm. Why didn't anyone tell me?"

5. **Decision Fatigue** - "If someone asks me 'what's for dinner?' one more time..."

### Goals

- Feel more in control without adding more work
- Share the mental load with technology (since family doesn't take it)
- Know mom-in-law is okay without hovering
- Never be surprised by school deadlines
- Reclaim evenings for actual family time

### How Hearth Helps Sarah

| Pain Point | Hearth Solution |
|------------|------------------|
| Mental overload | Morning briefing anticipates the day |
| Invisible labor | Proactive reminders for everyone |
| Elder worry | Daily check-in calls with summaries |
| School chaos | LMS integration surfaces deadlines early |
| Decision fatigue | Proposes dinner options, doesn't ask |

### Quote

> "I don't need another app to manage. I need something that actually *reduces* my to-do list."
