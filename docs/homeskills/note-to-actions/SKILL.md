# Note to Actions Skill

Transform information into action through atomic habit extraction and implementation planning.

## Philosophy

This skill applies behavior change science to extract actionable habits from any content:

1. **Atomic**: Break down to smallest possible action
2. **Obvious**: Create clear cues/triggers
3. **Attractive**: Link to existing desires
4. **Easy**: Reduce friction to minimum
5. **Satisfying**: Build in immediate rewards

## When to Use

- User shares an article or link
- User shares a YouTube video
- User mentions a book or podcast
- User asks "how do I apply this?"
- User wants to turn an idea into action
- User says "I want to start doing X"

## Workflow Overview

```
1. Receive Content → 2. Extract Key Insights → 3. Identify Habits
→ 4. Make Atomic → 5. Create Implementation Plan → 6. Set Up System
```

## Step 1: Content Intake

### When User Shares a Link

**Fetch and analyze:**
```
📝 PROCESSING CONTENT

URL: [Link]
Type: [Article / Video / Podcast]
Topic: [Detected topic]
Length: [Estimated read/watch time]

Analyzing for actionable insights...
```

### When User Shares an Idea

**Clarify the idea:**
```
💡 IDEA CAPTURED

You said: "[User's input]"

To help you act on this, let me understand:

1. What outcome do you want?
2. Why does this matter to you?
3. What's stopped you before? (if applicable)

[Or proceed with analysis if clear]
```

## Step 2: Extract Key Insights

**Summary format:**
```
📚 CONTENT SUMMARY

[Title/Topic]

━━━ KEY INSIGHTS ━━━

1. [Insight 1]
   • [Supporting detail]

2. [Insight 2]
   • [Supporting detail]

3. [Insight 3]
   • [Supporting detail]

━━━ MAIN TAKEAWAY ━━━

"[Single sentence core message]"

━━━ APPLICABLE TO YOUR LIFE ━━━

[Connection to user's known goals/situation]

Want me to extract specific habits from this?
```

## Step 3: Identify Potential Habits

**Habit extraction:**
```
🎯 POTENTIAL HABITS IDENTIFIED

From this content, I found [X] actionable habits:

━━━ HABIT 1 ━━━

📝 Original idea: "[From content]"

⬇️ Translated to behavior:
"[Specific observable action]"

📊 Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
⏰ Time required: [Duration]
🎯 Impact: [High/Medium/Low]

━━━ HABIT 2 ━━━

[Same format...]

━━━ HABIT 3 ━━━

[Same format...]

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
Start with Habit [X] - it's [easiest/highest impact].

Which one(s) interest you?
```

## Step 4: Make It Atomic

**Atomic habit breakdown:**
```
⚛️ ATOMIC HABIT DESIGN

Your goal: "[Selected habit]"

Let's make it atomic (2-minute version):

━━━ THE BREAKDOWN ━━━

FULL HABIT:
"[Full version - e.g., 'Exercise 30 minutes daily']"

⬇️

ATOMIC VERSION:
"[2-minute version - e.g., 'Put on workout clothes']"

🎯 The idea: Make it so easy you can't say no.
   Once you start, momentum builds.

━━━ HABIT STACKING ━━━

Attach to existing habit:

"After I [CURRENT HABIT],
 I will [NEW ATOMIC HABIT]."

Examples for you:
• "After I pour my morning coffee, I will [habit]."
• "After I sit down at my desk, I will [habit]."
• "After I brush my teeth at night, I will [habit]."

Which existing habit should we attach to?
```

## Step 5: Implementation Planning

**Complete implementation plan:**
```
📝 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Habit: [Habit name]

━━━ THE 4 LAWS ━━━

1️⃣ MAKE IT OBVIOUS (Cue)

   Trigger: "After I [existing habit]..."
   
   Environmental design:
   • [Physical change to make cue visible]
   • [Remove friction from seeing/starting]
   
   Implementation intention:
   "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
   
   Your intention:
   "I will _____________ at _____________ in _____________"

2️⃣ MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE (Craving)

   Temptation bundling:
   "After I [HABIT I NEED], I get to [HABIT I WANT]"
   
   Example:
   "After I do my 2-minute workout, I get to check social media."
   
   Your bundle:
   "After I _____________, I get to _____________"

3️⃣ MAKE IT EASY (Response)

   2-minute rule version:
   "[Easiest possible version]"
   
   Reduce friction:
   • [Step to prepare in advance]
   • [Thing to set out the night before]
   • [Obstacle to remove]
   
   Prime your environment:
   "Tonight, I'll [preparation step] so tomorrow it's easy."

4️⃣ MAKE IT SATISFYING (Reward)

   Immediate reward:
   "After completing, I will [small celebration/reward]"
   
   Tracking:
   • I'll track this habit with: [Method]
   • Visual streak: [How to display progress]
   
   Celebration:
   "My micro-celebration: [Fist pump, checkmark, etc.]"

━━━ ACCOUNTABILITY ━━━

Habit contract:
"I commit to [HABIT] starting [DATE].
If I miss, my consequence is [SMALL STAKE].
My accountability partner: [NAME/ME]"

Ready to commit?
```

## Step 6: System Setup

**Activate the habit system:**
```
✅ HABIT ACTIVATED

Your new habit:
"🎯 [Habit statement]"

━━━ I'VE SET UP ━━━

⏰ REMINDERS:
• Daily at [TIME]: "Time for [habit]!"
• [Cue-based reminder if applicable]

📊 TRACKING:
• I'll ask you each day if you did it
• Streak tracking enabled
• Weekly progress reports

🎉 CELEBRATIONS:
• I'll celebrate milestones with you
• 7-day, 21-day, 66-day markers

━━━ YOUR COMMITMENT ━━━

Starting: [DATE]
First check-in: [TOMORROW]

💬 I'll gently ask tomorrow:
"Did you [habit] today?"

You've got this! 💪
```

## Habit Check-Ins

**Daily check-in:**
```
💬 HABIT CHECK-IN

Did you [habit] today?

[Yes ✅] [No ❌] [Partial 🟡]
```

**If yes:**
```
🎉 GREAT JOB!

[Habit] ✅ Complete!

🔥 Streak: [X] days
📊 This week: [X]/7

[Encouraging message based on streak length]

Keep it going! Tomorrow is day [X+1].
```

**If no (with compassion):**
```
💬 NO WORRIES

Missing one day doesn't break the habit.
Never miss twice in a row - that's the real rule.

🤔 Quick reflection:
• What got in the way?
• How can we adjust for tomorrow?

💡 Remember:
"You don't rise to the level of your goals.
You fall to the level of your systems."

Let's make tomorrow easier. What barrier can we remove?
```

**Assistant:**
```
🧘 MEDITATION HABIT

Let's make this happen! Instead of "meditate daily,"
let's start atomic:

⚛️ ATOMIC VERSION:
"Sit quietly and take 3 deep breaths"

⏰ Time needed: 30 seconds
🎯 Success rate: Very high (it's tiny!)

━━━ YOUR IMPLEMENTATION ━━━

1️⃣ CUE: "After I pour my morning coffee..."

2️⃣ ROUTINE: "...I sit down and take 3 deep breaths."

3️⃣ REWARD: "Then I enjoy my first sip mindfully."

📋 MAKE IT EASY:
• Put a sticky note by coffee maker: "Breathe"
• Don't try to do more (resist!)
• After 2 weeks, we can expand to 1 minute

⏰ I'll remind you tomorrow morning.

Start with just 3 breaths?
